### 1. What is the App About?

**Name:** Mystic Banana | Modern Spiritual Magazine

**Purpose:** The application is designed as a modern online magazine focused on spiritual content. It aims to provide users with spiritual insights, tarot readings, horoscopes, astrology, featured content (articles/blogs), podcasts, and a personalized user dashboard. Includes AI-assisted article generation capabilities.

**Target Audience:** Individuals interested in spirituality, personal growth, astrology, tarot, and related mystical topics.

### 2. App Flow

**A. Unauthenticated User Journey:**
1.  **Landing:** Users arrive at the `HomePage` (`/`).
2.  **Browsing:** They can view various sections like Hero, Featured Content, Featured Podcasts, Daily Tarot, Categories, Subscription offers, Testimonials, and a Newsletter signup form.
3.  **Authentication Options:** Users can navigate to:
    *   `LoginPage` (`/login`)
    *   `SignupPage` (`/signup`)
4.  **Protected Routes:** Attempting to access `/dashboard` will redirect an unauthenticated user to `/login`.

**B. Authentication Flow (Supabase Integrated):**
1.  **Signup (`/signup`):
    *   Users provide their Full Name, Email Address, and Password.
    *   The `authStore`'s `register` function calls Supabase to create a new user in `auth.users` and a corresponding entry in `public.profiles`.
    *   Social signup options (Google, Facebook) are present as UI elements but are non-functional placeholders (`href="#"`).
    *   Terms of Service and Privacy Policy links are placeholders (`/terms`, `/privacy`).
2.  **Login (`/login`):
    *   Users provide their Email Address and Password.
    *   The `authStore`'s `login` function calls Supabase to authenticate the user.
    *   On successful login, session data and user profile information (from `public.profiles`) are loaded into the `authStore`.
    *   A "Remember me" checkbox is present (frontend state only).
    *   A "Forgot your password?" link is present but leads to `/forgot-password` (placeholder).
    *   Social login options (Google, Facebook) are present as UI elements but are non-functional placeholders.

**C. Authenticated User Journey:**
1.  **Dashboard Access:** Authenticated users can access their `DashboardPage` (`/dashboard`).
2.  **Dashboard Features:** The dashboard displays:
    *   A welcome message (e.g., "Welcome back, {user?.name}").
    *   `DashboardOverview` component.
    *   `SavedContent` component.
    *   `RecentActivity` component.
    (Data for these components will be driven by user data from `public.profiles` and related content tables once `contentStore.ts` is integrated.)
3.  **Logout:** The `authStore`'s `logout` function calls Supabase to invalidate the session and clears local user state.
4.  **Premium Features:** The `public.profiles` table has an `is_premium` flag, and `authStore` can map this, suggesting backend support for premium status.

### 3. What is Implemented?

*   **Frontend Framework:** React (v18.3.1) with Vite as the build tool.
*   **Language:** TypeScript.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, with `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js`.
*   **Routing:** Client-side routing implemented using `react-router-dom` (v6.18.0) for `HomePage`, `LoginPage`, `SignupPage`, and `DashboardPage`.
*   **State Management:** Zustand (`zustand` v4.4.4) is used for global state:
    *   `authStore.ts`: Manages authentication state. **Fully integrated with Supabase Authentication** (login, registration, logout, session management, fetching user profiles from `public.profiles` table).
    *   `contentStore.ts`: Manages content state (articles, podcasts, etc.). **Currently uses mock data and requires integration with Supabase tables.**
*   **UI Components:**
    *   Structured into `pages` and `components`.
    *   Utilizes `lucide-react`, `@headlessui/react`, `framer-motion`, `swiper`.
*   **Core Pages Structure:**
    *   `HomePage`, `LoginPage`, `SignupPage`, `DashboardPage` structures are in place.
*   **Backend (Supabase):**
    *   **Authentication:** Full integration with Supabase Auth.
        *   User registration (email/password) linked to `public.profiles` table creation via trigger.
        *   User login (email/password).
        *   Session management and persistence via `authStore`'s `initializeAuth`.
        *   User profile data (name, avatar, preferences, premium status, admin status) stored in `public.profiles` table.
    *   **Database Tables Created:**
        *   `public.profiles`: Stores user-specific data, extending `auth.users`. Includes `id` (FK to `auth.users`), `email`, `name`, `avatar_url`, `is_premium`, `is_admin`, `preferences` (JSONB), `saved_content` (JSONB).
        *   `public.articles`: Stores article data. Includes `id`, `title`, `slug`, `content`, `excerpt`, `category_id` (FK to `categories`), `author_id` (FK to `auth.users`), `status`, `published_at`, `featured_image_url`, `is_premium`, `meta_title`, `meta_description`, `tags`.
        *   `public.categories`: Stores category data. Includes `id`, `name`, `slug`, `description`. (Note: `ai_prompt` and `ai_model` columns needed for AI generation are not in the `create_categories.sql` script but are used by the Edge Function).
    *   **Supabase Edge Function (`generate-ai-article`):**
        *   **Functionality:** Generates new articles using AI (OpenAI) and finds related images (Pexels).
        *   **Trigger:** Authenticated HTTP request (likely from an admin interface).
        *   **Process:** Fetches category-specific `ai_prompt` and `ai_model` from `categories` table, calls OpenAI API, fetches image from Pexels API, uploads image to Supabase Storage (`images` bucket), and saves the article to the `articles` table as a draft.
        *   **Dependencies:** Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `PEXELS_API_KEY` environment variables.
*   **Linting:** ESLint is configured (`eslint.config.js`).

### 4. What is Left Out / Needs Implementation?

*   **Critical - Backend Integration for Content:**
    *   **`contentStore.ts` Overhaul:** Refactor `contentStore.ts` to fetch all dynamic content (articles, podcasts, tarot readings, horoscopes, categories, testimonials) from the respective Supabase tables instead of using mock data.
        *   Implement functions to fetch lists of articles (all, by category, featured).
        *   Implement functions to fetch individual articles by slug or ID.
        *   Implement similar fetching logic for podcasts, tarot readings, horoscopes once their Supabase table schemas are defined and populated.
    *   **`categories` Table Update:** The `public.categories` table needs `ai_prompt` (TEXT) and `ai_model` (TEXT) columns to be added to fully support the `generate-ai-article` Edge Function. This might involve a new migration script.
    *   **Database Tables for Other Content Types:** Define and create Supabase tables for Podcasts, Tarot Readings, Horoscopes, and Testimonials if these are to be dynamic.
    *   **User Data Persistence (Content-Related):**
        *   Implement backend logic for `saved_content` in `public.profiles` (e.g., an array of article IDs). Update `authStore` or `contentStore` to manage this.
        *   Implement backend logic for `RecentActivity` for the dashboard.
*   **Placeholder Features to Implement:**
    *   **Social Logins:** Implement actual OAuth flows for Google and Facebook using Supabase Authentication.
    *   **"Forgot Password" Functionality:** Design and implement a password reset flow using Supabase Auth.
    *   **Terms of Service & Privacy Policy:** Create actual pages and content for `/terms` and `/privacy`.
    *   **Newsletter Signup:** Connect the newsletter signup form to a backend service (e.g., a Supabase Edge Function that adds emails to a list or integrates with an email marketing provider).
    *   **Subscription Section & Premium Content:** Implement the full flow for users to subscribe/upgrade to premium. This involves:
        *   Payment gateway integration (e.g., Stripe).
        *   A Supabase Edge Function to handle payment webhooks and update the `is_premium` flag in the `public.profiles` table.
        *   Protecting premium content/features based on the `user.isPremium` status.
    *   **Admin Interface for AI Article Generation:** A UI for admins to trigger the `generate-ai-article` Edge Function, select categories, and manage generated content.
*   **API Key Management:** Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `PEXELS_API_KEY` are securely stored as environment variables in the Supabase project settings for the Edge Function.
*   **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling for Supabase API calls in stores and components. Provide user-friendly feedback.
*   **User Preferences Management:** Build UI and backend logic for users to update their `preferences` (stored in `public.profiles`).

### 5. Feedback and Suggestions

*   **Prioritize `contentStore.ts` Integration:** This is the most critical next step for dynamic content. Focus on fetching articles from the `articles` table first.
*   **Update `categories` Table Schema:** Add `ai_prompt` and `ai_model` columns to the `public.categories` table via a new Supabase migration. This is essential for the AI article generation feature.
*   **Define Schemas for Remaining Content:** Create SQL scripts or migrations for `podcasts`, `tarot_readings`, `horoscopes`, and `testimonials` tables if they are to be dynamic.
*   **Iterative Feature Implementation:** Once content fetching is in place, iteratively implement other features (social login, forgot password, newsletter, premium subscriptions).
*   **Develop Admin Capabilities:** Plan and build an admin dashboard for managing users, content (including triggering AI generation and publishing articles), and categories.
*   **Content Strategy:** Further define how AI-generated content will be reviewed, edited, and published.
*   **User Experience (UX) Enhancements:**
    *   Provide clear loading indicators for all asynchronous operations.
    *   Implement comprehensive form validation (client-side and server-side).
*   **Security for Edge Functions:** Review security for any Edge Functions that modify data, ensuring proper authorization checks (e.g., only admins can trigger article generation).

### 6. Tips for Optimization and Other Stuff

*   **Environment Variables:** Continue to use `.env` files for local development and Supabase project environment variables for deployed functions/apps.
*   **Image Optimization:** The `generate-ai-article` function fetches images; ensure these are reasonably sized. Consider Supabase Storage image transformations if available/needed.
*   **Lazy Loading & Code Splitting:** Continue best practices.
*   **Bundle Size Analysis:** Periodically analyze.
*   **API Design with Supabase:** Leverage RLS for data protection. Ensure efficient queries in `contentStore.ts` once integrated.
*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   Add tests for `authStore.ts` interactions with Supabase.
    *   Plan tests for `contentStore.ts` once it's integrated.
    *   Consider testing Edge Functions locally or with mock data.
*   **TypeScript Strictness:** Maintain.
*   **Security:** Be mindful of Supabase RLS policies for all tables. Ensure service role keys are not exposed client-side.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Consider setting this up for automated builds, tests, and Supabase schema migrations/function deployments.
*   **State Management Review:** As `contentStore.ts` is refactored, ensure it remains manageable.

This report reflects the significant progress made, especially with Supabase authentication and the introduction of AI-powered content generation. The next major phase will be integrating the frontend content stores with the Supabase backend.
